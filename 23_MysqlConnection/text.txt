Ways to connect to MySql DB in php
1) MySqLi -> procedural and object oriented
--> In MySqli we can have 2 methods by which we can use it. procedural and object oriented way.
--> In procedural we make use of functions

2) PDO

--> PDO is used when we want to connect to multiple databases(when there are multiple dbs in our applications and we are switching between multiple dbs in our project)
--> MySqli is used when we want to connect to single database
